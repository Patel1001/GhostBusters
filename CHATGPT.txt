## AI USAGE 

In this project, AI (Chat GPT) was used both for general understanding and also for some specific problems and syntax learning. We will list them one by one


1. General understanding about Threads  -

Most of the concepts used in this assignment have been used before in assignments but this was the first time for us using threads so we used ChatGPT to understand in detail how threads work and how to work with multiple threads at the same time and how to call different function using those threads. ChatGPT gave a good explanation along with some general simple examples which helped us understand the topic better.



2 Syntax for Threads - 

We were confused on how to use the 4 threads for 4 hunters and if we only use one main thread function or 4 different ones so we used ChatGPT to how to approach the 4 threads and understand the syntax. Chat gpt gave the idea of using an array of threads containing the 4 
Threads and using the individual threads in the array in the thread function which we applied in our project. We also used lecture notes and lecture videos to get some syntax for the array of threads.




3 Help with understanding semaphores and how to use them with multiple threads

While we studied semaphores in class, we were a bit confused on how they work and how to use them with multiple threads so we asked gpt to explain the concept as a whole and give us an example on how to use them. It gave us a detailed explanation as well as a simple example to help us understand the concept in more detail.




4 Help with what causes deadlocks -

After applying the semaphores, we were confused on which type of deadlock situations we can run into, so we asked gpt to help us understand what can be potential reasons for deadlocks in general which gave us a better understanding. We also used the FAQ posed on the discord channel by the prof.


5. Valgrind report simplification 

We used gpt to simply the memory leak messages we were getting so that we can understand where we were not deallocating memory.
